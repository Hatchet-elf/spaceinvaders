# Space Invaders

This is my first attempt at a full game. It is written in C and uses the Curses library.

## Getting Started

The game comes with a makefile. Simply type make when in the directory and it will compile.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the Curses library. The below command will install it if you don't already have it.

```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```
